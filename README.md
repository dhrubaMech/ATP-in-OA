# About this project
This project presents a comprehensive mathematical model of **ATP metabolism in chondrocytes**, developed to explore the metabolic dynamics underlying **osteoarthritis (OA)** progression. 
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease marked by the breakdown of articular cartilage, which is especially susceptible to metabolic stress due to its avascular nature.
Chondrocytes operate under hypoxic stress and rely on a finely regulated balance between **glycolysis** and **oxidative phosphorylation** (OXPHOS) for energy production.

Our model captures the **bistable metabolic switching** between these two pathways, simulating how chondrocytes adapt to varying oxygen and glucose levels - including stochastic fluctuations mimicking physiological changes during mechanical loading.

## Key features:
- Simulates **metabolic regulation** in chondrocytes under hypoxic stress
- Accounts for **stochastic nutrient variability** to reflect in vivo conditions
- Predicts how **chronic hypoxia induces irreversible glycolytic shifts**
- Tests **therapeutic strategies**, showing that -
  - ECM supplementation alone offers only short-term benefits
  - Metabolic interventions targeting ATP synthesis are essential for recovery
 
## Goal:
This model serves as a tool for understanding cartilage energy metabolism and evaluating **personalized treatment strategies** that combine metabolic modulation and structural support.
It provides a framework for designing **multi-modal therapies** aimed at restoring cartilage homeostasis and preventing the progression of osteoarthritis.

## Requirements
